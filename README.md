# Cpnt262-a1- Codepen init()

by  Lynn Chen     Oct,26,2020



## Comments

This project is named "Home Piano with JS and CSS3â€œ,which is from Codepen.

Actually,  I chose 3 different codepen for this assessment. However, two of them could work both before and after adding the `init` function; another one could not work neither before nor after adding the `init` function. 



## Attributions

The codepen I chose for this assignment ,comes from Fabio Baziota:
