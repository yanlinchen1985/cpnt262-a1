# Cpnt262-a1- Codepen init()

## Comments

This project is named "Home Piano with JS and CSS3â€œ,which is from Codepen.

Actually,  I chose 3 different codepen for this assessment. However, two of them could work both before and after adding the `init` function; another one could not work neither before nor after adding the `init` function. 

I feel that after entering JS, the course is more challenging than before , because many things are not as intuitive to see as in the course about HTML and CSS.
